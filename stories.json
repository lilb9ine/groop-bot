      "Kunle adjusted his tie nervously as he stepped into the buzzing office of Nova Media. It was his first day as a junior strategist, and Lagos traffic had already made him twenty minutes late. At the far end of the room, Adebisi glanced up from her sleek MacBook. Her expression was unreadable — calm, poised, and a little dangerous. She had heard they were bringing in a new guy. “You’re late,” she said without looking at him again. Kunle swallowed. So this was the team lead. Great start.",
      
      "The welcome meeting ended awkwardly, with Adebisi barely acknowledging Kunle. He was assigned to her team — and the tension was already thick. During lunch, he stepped out to call someone. \"Teni, it’s me. I’m at the new job. You wouldn’t believe who my boss is.\" Teni’s voice cracked. \"Is it her? Adebisi from UNILAG?\" Kunle froze. He hadn’t told her. \"So this is how I find out?\" she said bitterly before hanging up. His ex-girlfriend and his new boss had history — and not the good kind.",
      
      "That evening, Adebisi walked into her favorite lounge in Lekki where her best friend Zainab was waiting. “Guess who just got assigned to my team,” she said, dropping her handbag. Zainab sipped her chapman and raised an eyebrow. “The Kunle from Marketing class?” Adebisi gave her a look. “He ghosted me in final year and now he's sitting two desks away.” Zainab smiled, “Omo, you better not fall again. Nova is a small office, but Lagos has big drama.”",
      
      "The next morning, an internal email mistakenly copied the entire team on a confidential pitch deck — including a file labeled 'Zion Bank – Rejected Concept by Adebisi'. Kunle opened it before it was deleted. The pitch was brilliant… and not rejected. He recognized the layout. It was his design — from a freelance job he did under NDA. Why was it in Nova’s system under Adebisi’s name?",
      
      "Kunle confronted her that evening. \"You used my design. You knew it was mine.\" Adebisi stared him down. \"I didn’t know it was yours — until now. We bought the rights. It was submitted by someone named K.O Designs.\" Kunle went silent. That was the alias Teni used to submit their joint work. His ex had sold their concept. And now, his boss had unknowingly pitched it under her name. The triangle was tighter than he thought — and about to explode."
